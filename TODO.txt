== TODO list

Code:

- Second baseline D

- GPU for NN training Se

- NN initialization and training D
	+ separate training from compression (modular)
	+ store default network


- Train NN with MANY images D
	+ get large set of (training) images
	
- Dynamic metrics/ Paramter optimization 
	+ SVD St
	+ NN:
	    - training params: St
	    - hidden values
	    - ..
	+ Quantization D
	+ Others:

- Runtime Optimization:
    - features extraction 
    - Others-> D to point it out
    - NN documentation 

- Entropy coding / Run length coding / arithmetic coding after quantization Se

- Finish pipeline:
    - Decide SVD between/how to use both Quanitization St


- Code refactoring and comments
	+ Meaningful variable names etc.
	
 - Test with other pictures (diff from traing ones)
 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Paper:

   - Compare with baselines
   - Write and improve paper
