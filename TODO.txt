== TODO list

- Dynamic metrics
	+ SVD
	+ NN
	+ Quantization
	+ Parameters

- Optimization
	+ NN and parameters (see also dynamic metrics)

- Write and improve paper

- Second baseline

- Code refactoring and comments
	+ Meaningful variable names etc.

- NN initialization and training
	+ separate training from compression (modular)
	+ store default network

- Entropy coding / Run length coding / arithmetic coding after quantization

- Finish pipeline

- Compare with baselines

- Train NN with MANY images
	+ get large set of (training) images
