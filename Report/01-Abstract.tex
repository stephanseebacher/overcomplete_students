In this paper we present our solution for the image compression assignment of the 2015 course \emph{Computational Intelligence Lab} at ETH Zurich. Our approach is heavily based on neural networks, and our focus lies on compression rate. We use quantization to further compress our image. Even though both operations are lossy, test results show that image quality is still acceptable at a compression rate of less than 1\%.
