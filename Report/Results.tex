We tested the compression algorithm with 100 images which were not in the training set and get a mean error of (......) and a compression rate of (......). 
\newline
Figure~\ref{fig:compare_images} shows an example image before any compression on the left and the reconstructed image after compression on the right. 
\newline
Idea: Test with training directly on image, and compare results with pre-training.

\subsection{Comparison to Baselines}
We compare our solution with two baselines. The first baseline is a compression algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM) and the second algorithm is based on (WHAT IS THE SECOND BASELINE AGAIN?).
