\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
In image compression, you can either have good image quality or good compression rates, as improving in one domain is detrimental for the other.\newpage The direct encoding approach focuses on compression ratio, and looking at the results we argue that it is performing quite well in this part. However, there is still room for improvement regarding time consumption and mean error. With an average runtime of 6 seconds and more for compression and decompression, the method is not yet suited for wide deployment. Potential for optimization lies in the quantization function, which currently uses more than half of the total time. Addressing the mean error, longer and thus better trained universal encoding and decoding neural networks can further reduce the mean error.
