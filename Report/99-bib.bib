	abstract = {We present a novel neural model for image compression called the direct classification (DC) model. The \{DC\} is a hybrid between a subset of the self-organizing Kohonen (SOK) model and the adaptive resonance theory (ART) model. The \{DC\} is a fast and efficient neural classification engine. The \{DC\} training utilizes the accuracy of the winner-takes-all feature of the \{SOK\} model and the elasticity/speed of the \{ART1\} model. The \{DC\} engine has experimentally achieved much better results than the state-of-the-art peer image compression techniques (e.g., \{JPEG2000\} and DjVu wavelet technology) especially in the domains of colored documents and still satellite images. We include a comprehensive analysis of the most important parameters of our \{DC\} system and their effects on system performance. }
