\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary}
We presented a new approach to image compression using a splitted neural network. This method already shows promising results while still being pretty basic in its nature. A more in-depth analysis of neural network methods might be needed to be able to exploit their full potential and get very good compression rates while also maintaining a low mean error.
