	Image compression with neural networks

README

	In MATLAB, load an image with imread(), convert to double and divide
	by 255. Then, compress the image by calling:
	>> compressed_image = Compress(original_image)
	
	Decompression is similar:
	>> reconstructed_image = Decompress(compressed_image)

	If you want to train the neural network again, or change one of the 
	parameters patch_size or hidden_layers, you need to have your training
	images ready in a subfolder called "Training_Set". The files
	"trained_net_k_?_z_?.mat" contain the neural network parts for the
	specified patch size (k) and amount of hidden layer nodes (z). If 
	this file doesn't exist the training function is triggered automatically.
